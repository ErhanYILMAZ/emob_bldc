 BLDC Reference Design with XMC4500 MCU

This repo contains reference BLDC(Brushlesss DC) motor controller files for Berlin Beuth University Electromobility faculty. It is called EMOB_BLDC. The hardware based on application note [TIDA-010056](https://www.ti.com/tool/TIDA-010056). XMC4500 mcu is used and the hardware has extra fatures like micro sd card slot, usb, can, uart gpio etc. [Here](https://github.com/ErhanYILMAZ/emob_bldc/blob/main/design/hardware/altium/outputs/pdf/PDF/Schematic.pdf) you can see the schematics and 3D outputs.

As sotfware I have used application note from infineon for XMC mcu's. [Here](https://www.infineon.com/dgdl/Infineon-APP_MotorControl_XMC_in_Motor_Control_Applications_XMC-TR-v02_00-EN.pdf?fileId=5546d4624cb7f111014ceb7aebc3268c) you can reach the app note. It does scalar control and includes many features like ramp startup, s startup, sensorless controller etc. The repos is for reference design for education purpose and there might has some bugs or mistakes. I do not take any responsibility. Please be aware of that and don't hesitate to reach me for any question or feedback and so on. Appreciated. Below you can see picture from the project.
